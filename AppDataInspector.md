# Introduction #
This is a new tool. Original creator Mihai Cadariu.

This tool offers a popup (accessed from context menu or ribbon button) or a tab in all views to display AppData for the selected Tridion item. AppId, Data, and Type and type show in table format.

# Details #

## Description ##

It performs a very simplistic deserialization of the data byte array (which can be improved greatly, although for the sole purpose of visualizing the data the current implementation might be enough --- you can check the service AppDataInspector.svc for details).

Things to note:

  * tool uses a popup and a tab GUI extensions, which both make use of a common worker class (which does the actual job)... so I can reuse the AJAX code

  * there is no Master tab, or Master tab control that would define the ProgressBar, Status, Dialog, Mask, etc. So the tab I created (AppDataInspectorTab.ascx) is a stand-alone control defining all these items locally. Don't know if/how we can use some kind of master layout with hierarchical controls in .NET? Is there a way?

  * the AppData is displayed in an HTML table. Not very elegant. We could use a Tridion GUI list control, but don't know how. Any thoughts on this? Or even better - examples?

## Purpose ##

Displays the AppData of the given item for the purpose of inspecting what actually is in there. Note that AppData currently is only available programmatically, so this tool is only for developers for knowing what kind of information is stored as AppData.
