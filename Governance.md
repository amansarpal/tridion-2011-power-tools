# Ownership #
The Tridion PowerTools is a GUI extension framework by the SDL Tridion community with help from the Tridion MVP and Community Builders. We appreciate your help on this open source project!

Basic rule: [Midas Rule of Open Source Projects](http://www.createandbreak.net/2011/10/midas-rule-of-open-source-projects.html)

> "Whoever touches something first (takes initiative) and cares the most gets to decide what to do with it."

# Go Ahead and Fix It #

  * If you see something wrong, go ahead and fix it.
  * If you're not sure, ask. Then go ahead and fix it.
  * If there's a better way of doing something, let us know. Explain to us why. Then go ahead and fix it.
  * We can't finish extensions if we're waiting for permission.
  * If it's important to you and you can fix it, go ahead and fix it.

# Process and Roadmap #

Leads guide the project, encourage participation, and make sure we meet objectives. Participants design, build, test, and encourage participation.

  * 3 MVP technical leads
  * 1 MVP functional lead
  * 5-10 community contributors overall
  * 2-3 community contributors per tool
  * As many testers as are available
  * Encourage participation, increase visibility (blog, tweet, forums) and keep an eye out for replacements for positions
# Product Management #
Requirements will come from old tool(s), requested functionality, and solicited feedback.

  * Leads guide requirements, prioritizes tools, and solicits community feedback
  * Team will share progress with SDL via email and Ideas submissions
  * We use an informal and simple design process

**_Project team should review individual tools at least twice a year. Consider scheduling a 6-month review at project onset._**
