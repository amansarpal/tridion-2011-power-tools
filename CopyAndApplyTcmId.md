# Introduction #

As an Editor I often have a component open or visible in the tree view in one Publication Context, but then need to find its path to:

  * Link to it from another component
  * Insert it onto a page as a Component Presentation

# Details #

I want the ability to "copy" or "save to clipboard" an open Component or Component in a list. Then, where applicable, use a "apply saved reference" type button to insert this reference into a Page or Component link (the current Publication context).

Related could be a list of recently opened or used Components, visible in the Component selection screens, showing those Component in the context of the current Publication.
