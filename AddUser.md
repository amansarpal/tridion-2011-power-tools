# Introduction #
In some environments it takes a very long time to browse the active directory or LDAP repository. This makes adding new users a slow or impossible task. This new context menu item makes adding new users very easy.

## Description ##
To add a user directly (from a domain or directory service), navigate to the users list, and right click to get a context menu in blank area of the list view. Under the PowerTools menu there is a new 'Add 'Non-Domain' user. When you click this you will be prompted to enter a DOMAIN\Username. Once the user has been created, you should open it to set the description and give the user Admin. privileges if needed.

Note that this tool is only available if the performer of the task normally has access to create new users.

## Audience ##
Admins and Power Users
