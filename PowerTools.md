The PowerTools extend the functionality of the Tridion Web Content Management (WCM) system, specifically as a Content Manager Explorer (CME) or GUI extension.

# Introduction #

The original PowerTools were "simply" classic .ASP pages that were installed by copying the flat files to the CMS server. The tools were available for Tridion 5.3 and mostly worked for Tridion 2009.

Tridion 2011 offers a new framework for extensions based on a new Core Service API for "back-end" internal data manipulation with a JavaScript front-end library called Anguilla. This tiered approach separates development concerns while introducing a new layer of complexity (basically everything's new again to most of everyone).
