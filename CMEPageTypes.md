## Like Experience Manager, but in the CME... ##

SiteEdit and Experience Manager have a feature called "Page Types" that lets authors create new pages. These pages have component presentations that either point to existing, re-used components or to duplicates of existing "prototype" components.

## Use Case ##

### Author Training ###
As a Tridion trainer, tester, or someone who needs to create similar, but independent pages and content, I would like the ability to take an existing page in Tridion and create a copy of it. I would also like the components it uses to be replaced by copies of these components, similar to how Page Types work in SiteEdit or Experience Manager.

### In-CMS DEV Developer Training ###
For development training, I'd be interested in a version that copied not just the page and components, but schemas and templates. The use case would be to take the existing relationships between schemas, components, pages, and template and create the same relationship, but it a separate set of items.

The alternative to this approach would be separate instances of Tridion or possibly localization among child publications; however, when training against a customer environment, the other options may not be practical.
