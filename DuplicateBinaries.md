# Introduction #

If developers are not careful, they can run into issues with multimedia components with duplicate file names colliding at deployment time resulting in publish transactions failing. This tool provides a way to recursively search multimedia components in a publication's folder structure to locate binaries with the same file name.

The tool is present on organizational items within a given publication.   Simply load the tool and click the **Find** button to generate a list of duplicately named items.
